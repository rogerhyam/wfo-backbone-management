### Placement Actions

There are five actions that can be taken to change a names placement

1. __Raise to accepted name__ A name that is a synonym or not yet placed in the taxonomy and has a nomenclatural status or Valid, Conserved or Sanctioned can become the accepted name of a taxon.
1. __Sink into synonym__ A name that is the accepted name of a taxon (which doesn't have children or synonyms) or has not yet been placed in the taxonomy can become a synonym in an accepted taxon.
1. __Change parent taxon__ A name that is the accepted name of a taxon can be moved to another part of the taxonomy.
1. __Change accepted taxon__ A name that is a synonym of one taxon can be moved to become the synonym of another taxon.
1. __Remove from taxonomy__ A name that forms part of the taxon as the accepted name of a taxon (which doesn't have children or synonyms) or is a synonym can be removed from the taxonomy.

### Placement Destinations

There are three rules that govern where a name can be placed in the taxonomy

1. __Nomenclatural Status__ Deprecated names can't be placed in the taxonomy at all. Names of all other statuses can be synonyms. Valid, Conserved and Sanctioned names can be accepted names of taxa.  
1. __Congruent Ranks__ The rank of a child taxon must be one of the accepted ranks of the parent according to the ranks table. e.g. a subspecies can't be a direct child of a genus or family.
1. __Congruent Name Parts__ The name parts of the parent taxon must agree with the genus string and species string part of the name. e.g. a species can only be in a genus which has a name-string that matches its genus-string and a subspecies can only be in a species that has the name-string and genus-string that agrees with its own species-string and genus-string.
