    <p>The consensus classification of plants used as the taxonomic backbone for the World Flora Online portal
        (<a href="https://www.worldfloraonline.org">https://www.worldfloraonline.org</a>) in support of Target 1 of the
        Global Strategy for Plant Conservation.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>wfo_plantlist_2022-12.zip</strong> The Catalogue of Life Data Package of the WFO Plant List. This is
            the most expressive standards based form of the list.</li>
        <li><strong>plant_list_2022-12.json.zip</strong> JSON formatted version of the WFO Plant List. This has been
            designed for direct import into a schemaless instance of a SOLR index and is used to drive the WFO Plant
            List API (<a href="https://list.worldfloraonline.org">https://list.worldfloraonline.org</a>)
            which in turn drives the WFO Plant List in the portal. This is recommended if you want a local, read only
            version of the list rather than use the API.</li>
        <li><strong>plant_list_2022-12.sql.gz</strong> This is the complete production database (minus logging data
            and API keys) as a MySQL backup file. It can be restored directly to a MySQL 5.7 or later instance if you
            require the list in SQL format.</li>
        <li><strong>ipni_to_wfo.csv.gz</strong> A file mapping all the IPNI IDs we track to their associated WFO IDs.
        </li>
        <li><strong>families_dwc.tar.gz</strong> Individual Darwin Core Archive files for each of 172 recognized
            families. If you want a single family in DwC but can't load the whole list download and expand this file.
            Family and genus files are also available for download through the portal.</li>
        <li><strong>_DwC_backbone_R.zip</strong> A single Darwin Core Archive file containing non deprecated names and
            taxa for use in the existing R package.</li>
        <li><strong>_uber.zip</strong> A single Darwin Core Archive file containing all names and taxa even those that
            are deprecated along with some extra columns</li>
    </ul>

    <p>New versions of this consensus classification are released every six months, in June and December, and used to
        publish the WFO Plant List (<a href="https://www.wfoplantlist.org">https://www.wfoplantlist.org</a>).</p>

    <p>The initial data ingestion into the World Flora Online taxonomic
        backbone was from The Plant List Version 1.1 (TPL, <a
            href="http://theplantlist.org">http://theplantlist.org</a>, September 2013), with the full list
        of
        contributing datasets given here: <a
            href="http://theplantlist.org/1.1/about/#collaborators">http://theplantlist.org/1.1/about/#collaborators</a>.
    </p>
    <p>New taxonomic names have been incorporated into WFO from nomenclators International Plant Name Index (IPNI,
        <a href="https://www.ipni.org">https://www.ipni.org</a>) for vascular
        plants, and Tropicos (<a href="https://www.tropicos.org">https://www.tropicos.org</a>) for bryophytes.
    </p>
    <p>Taxonomic and nomenclatural updates have been incorporated from the WFO's Taxonomic Expert Networks and the
        World Checklist of Vascular Plants version 2.0 (WCVP, <a
            href="https://wcvp.science.kew.org"></a>https://wcvp.science.kew.org</a>), facilitated by the Royal
        Botanic Gardens, Kew.</p>
