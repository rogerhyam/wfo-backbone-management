<p>The consensus taxonomy of plants used as the backbone for the <a href="https://www.worldfloraonline.org/">World
        Flora Online</a> (WFO) portal, and issued as editions of the <a href="https://wfoplantlist.org/">WFO Plant
        List</a>.</p>
<p>New versions of this checklist are released every six months in June and December: this is release
    2024-06.</p>
<p>The history of data development for the WFO taxonomic backbone is given on the WFO Plant List <a
        href="https://wfoplantlist.org/background">background page</a>. Taxonomic names are incorporated into WFO from
    nomenclators <a href="https://www.ipni.org/">International Plant Name Index</a> (IPNI) for vascular plants, and <a
        href="https://www.tropicos.org/home">Tropicos</a> for bryophytes. Taxonomic and nomenclatural updates are
    incorporated from the WFO's <a href="https://about.worldfloraonline.org/tens">Taxonomic Expert Networks</a> (TENs)
    and
    the <a href="https://powo.science.kew.org/about-wcvp">World Checklist of Vascular Plants</a> (WCVP), facilitated by
    the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.</p>

<p>This data repository includes the following files:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>wfo_plantlist_2024-06.zip</strong> The Catalogue of Life Data Package of the WFO Plant List. This is the
        most expressive standards based form of the list.</li>
    <li><strong>plant_list_2024-06.json.gz</strong> JSON formatted version of the WFO Plant List. This has been
        designed for direct import into a schemaless instance of a SOLR index and is used to drive the WFO Plant List
        API (<a href="https://list.worldfloraonline.org">https://list.worldfloraonline.org</a>) which in turn drives the
        WFO Plant List in the portal. This is recommended if you want a local, read only version of the list rather than
        use the API.</li>
    <li><strong>plant_list_2024-06.sql.gz</strong> This is the complete production database (minus API
        keys) as a MySQL backup file. It can be restored directly to a MySQL 8.0 or later instance if you require the
        list in SQL format.</li>
    <li><strong>ipni_to_wfo.csv.gz</strong> A file mapping all the IPNI IDs we track to their associated WFO IDs.</li>
    <li><strong>families_dwc.tar.gz</strong> Individual Darwin Core Archive files for each of 718 recognized families.
        If you want a single family in DwC but can&#39;t load the whole list download and expand this file. Family and
        genus files are also available for download through the portal. These files exclude deprecated names.</li>
    <li><strong>_DwC_backbone_R.zip</strong> A single Darwin Core Archive file containing non deprecated names and taxa
        for use in the existing R package.</li>
    <li><strong>_uber.zip</strong> A single Darwin Core Archive file containing all names and taxa even those that are
        deprecated along with some extra columns</li>
</ul>
