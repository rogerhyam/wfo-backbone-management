notes: "Note on persistence of IDs. Identifiers for NAMES remain constant and of the\
   \ form wfo-0000000000. Identifiers for TAXA are of the form wfo-0000000000-YY-MM\
   \ and change with each release to show that they belong to a different taxonomic\
   \ treatment and may not be directly comparable. There are associated HTTP URIs\
   \ with these short identifiers of the form https://list.worldfloraonline.org/<name or taxon identifier>.\
   \ These HTTP URIs support an API that enables navigation between different versions of the taxonomy.\
   \ See  https://list.worldfloraonline.org/ for details. For humans, using a web\
   \ browser, the associated HTTP URIs will redirect to the WFO Portal.\
   \ For machines they will provide data."
