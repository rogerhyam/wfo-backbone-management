   The consensus taxonomy of plants used as a backbone for the World Flora Online portal
   in support of Target 1 of the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation.
   New versions of this checklist are released every six months in June and December. This is release {{version}}.
   The initial data ingestion into the World Flora Online taxonomic backbone was from 
   The Plant List Version 1.1 (TPL, http://theplantlist.org, September 2013), with the full list of contributing datasets given here: http://theplantlist.org/1.1/about/#collaborators. 
   New taxonomic names have been incorporated into WFO from nomenclators International Plant Name Index (IPNI, https://www.ipni.org) 
   for vascular plants, and Tropicos (https://www.tropicos.org) for bryophytes. 
   Taxonomic and nomenclatural updates have been incorporated from the WFO's Taxonomic Expert Networks
   and the World Checklist of Vascular Plants version 2.0 (WCVP, http://wcvp.science.kew.org), facilitated by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.

notes: >
   Note on persistence of IDs. Identifiers for NAMES remain constant and of the form wfo-0000000000. 
   Identifiers for TAXA are of the form wfo-0000000000-YY-MM and change with each release to show that they belong to a different taxonomic treatment and may not be directly comparable.
   There are associated HTTP URIs with these short identifiers of the form https://list.worldfloraonline.org/<name or taxon identifier>.
   These HTTP URIs support an API that enables navigation between different versions of the taxonomy. See  https://list.worldfloraonline.org/ for details.
   For humans, using a web browser, the associated HTTP URIs will redirect to the WFO Portal. For machines they will provide data.
