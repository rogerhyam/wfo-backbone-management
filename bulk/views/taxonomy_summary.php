<p>This phase always follows name matching and import of taxonomic data (apart from name statuses and ranks which are reported on here).</p>

<p><strong>Mapping:</strong> 
    Here we fill in the rhakhis_parent, rhakhis_accepted and rhakhis_basionym columns in the table. 
    Note these are expressing the taxonomy in the table in terms of WFO IDs. 
    They are nothing to do with the classification in Rhakhis at this point but the map to the NAMES in Rhakhis.
</p>

<p><strong>Browse:</strong>
    Once we have populated the tree structure that is in the table in a uniform way we can browse it using this tool.
    The taxonomy in this browser comes from the data table but the  name information comes from Rhakhis.
    The nomenclatural data in the table and in Rhakhis should be equivalents by now anyhow.

    There are links in the browser to launch an impact report ...

<p><strong>Impact:</strong>
    This takes a WFO ID for a taxon that is both in Rhakhis and in the data table.
    It then runs through the taxonomy in Rhakhis and the data table and creates a report of 
    what the effect of replacing the Rhakhis taxonomy with that in the data table would be.
